    "Generally EDA is the exploration of data and relationships among data through both numerical and graphical methods. EDA is the first step in the larger process of finding features in data or ask further questions about data to have clear insight of data and the purpose of the analysis. EDA also helps in building up predictive models. EDA also helps in confirming our assumptions and insights about data sets.\n",
