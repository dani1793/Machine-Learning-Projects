    "Generative Adveserial Networks (GAN) are type of neural network architecture that is originally designed to generate samples which are close to orignal sample space. As the name suggests it is Generative network, which means that there is no supervised learning required. The general structure of GANs is provided in figure below. The figure shows two different networks present in the framework. They are commonly named Generator Network and Discriminator Network."

    "The two networks could be categorized as adversaries of each other. The basic purpose of the Generator Network is to learn the data distribution which is almost equivalent to original data distribution. The Generator Network starts with the noisy distribution and starts to learn from it. The network learns from the feedback provided by the Discriminator Network. The Discriminator could generally be any function that is differentiable. The network is trained on the sample latent data that have dimensions less than or equal to that of original data. Using this strategy allows the Generator to learn so generic features and represent the sample space in less dimesions. This ease the way to create further samples which are not in the original space. Inputs to the generator are randomly sampled from the modelâ€™s prior over the latent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Discriminator Network is provided with two types of data; the original data and the noisy data (i.e: data from Generator Network). Discriminator Network could be thought of as a binary classifier. The task of this binary classifier is to distinguish original data from generated data. It outputs 1 when the classifier thinks that the data is from original distribution and it outputs 0 if the classifier thinks that the data is from Generator Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall framework of GAN could be seen as a two player game where Generator Network is trying to get past the Discriminator Network by making it believe that the generated sample is from the original distibution. On the other hand Discriminator Network tries it best to not be fooled by Generative Network. In Ideal case If both models have sufficient capacity, then the Nash equilibrium of this game corresponds to the G(z) being drawn from the same distribution as the training data, and D(x) = 1/2 for all x.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The GANs have mostly similar to VAEs, the most salient difference is that, if relying on standard backprop, VAEs cannot have discrete variables at the input to the generator, while GANs cannot have discrete variables at the output of the generator. The GAN approximation is subject to the failures of supervised learning: overfitting and underfitting.**"

    "In second part, generator is fed with latent variables from model's prior. The Generator tries to create fake data items and those data items are passed to Discriminator Network. In this part, the goal of Generator is to keep the output near to 1 whereas Discriminator tries to keep output near 0.\n",

Imagine a scenerio where discriminator successfully rejects generator samples with high confidence, in this case the generators's gradients vanishes. This could be intuitively seen in the above equation of cost function for discriminator. When D(G(z)) is 0 or near zero than the cost is almost zero, and taking derivative with zero initial value will vanish the gradients before reaching the input layer of neural network.\n",
